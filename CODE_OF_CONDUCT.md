# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of this project, we pledge to respect all people who contribute through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

We are committed to making participation in this project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, or religion.

Participants are expected to show relentless sanskars. Commit message should be accompanied by a short mantra/verse from religion you follow. Contributor should be present in the Maha-Aarti prior to the build run in Travis CI. 

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include the use of sexual language or imagery, derogatory comments or personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct. In case any such behaviour is observed, you would be asked to attend a mandatory counselling session by Alok Nath before your issues/pull requests are considered. 

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct. Project maintainers who do not follow the Code of Conduct may be removed from the project team.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting one or more of the project maintainers.

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](http://contributor-covenant.org/), version 1.0.0, available from http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/
